//! Generic data models for the `adapters` crate.
//!
//! These models define common, abstracted representations of Lightning Network
//! entities (e.g., NodeInfo, Channel, Transaction) that can be used by any
//! adapter implementation, allowing the backend services to interact with
//! a consistent data format.
